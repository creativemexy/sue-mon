# Logo Setup Instructions

## To complete the logo integration:

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in the `public/images/` directory
   - The image should be high quality (at least 200x200px)
   - PNG format recommended for transparency support
   - The logo will be automatically resized to fit the navbar

2. **Logo will be used in:**
   - ✅ Navbar (top left corner)
   - ✅ Browser favicon
   - ✅ Apple touch icon
   - ✅ All page titles updated to "Sue & Mon"

3. **Fallback system:**
   - If the logo image fails to load, it will show "S&M" text
   - This ensures the site works even without the image

4. **File structure:**
   ```
   public/
   └── images/
       └── logo.png  ← Add your logo here
   ```

## Current Status:
- ✅ Navbar updated to use `/images/logo.png`
- ✅ Favicon updated to use your logo
- ✅ Page titles updated to "Sue & Mon"
- ✅ Fallback text added for reliability

Just add your logo image file and it will be automatically integrated!
